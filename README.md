# Netflix Financials

These are estimators for Netflix's 2017 revenue and net income. I built these as part of
a final project for UCLA's [ENGR 111](http://catalog.registrar.ucla.edu/ucla-cat2016-322.html) course in Fall 2016.
The report where explanations are given for the numbers used is not presently public.
